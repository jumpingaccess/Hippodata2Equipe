## Usage

### Import Interface

- In Equipe, open a meeting
- Click on "Import from Hippodata" action
- In the window that opens:
  - Enter the FEI Show ID (Event identifier)
  - Click "Search Event"
  - The system will display:
    - Event name and venue
    - List of all classes/competitions
    - Import status for each item (✓ = already imported)

### Import Options

- For each class, you can select:

  - ☐ Class Import: Import the competition definition
  - ☐ Startlist Import: Import riders, horses and entries
  - ☐ Result Import: Import competition results
  - ☐ Team Class: Mark as team competition (Nations Cup)
  - FEI Article: Select the competition format

- Team Competitions
  - When "Team Class" is checked:
    - Automatically creates teams based on nations
    - Only nations with 3+ riders get a team
    - Creates clubs with country flags
    - Links riders to their national teams
    - Handles team-specific results (abstained riders count for team)

- Import Status Indicators
  - ✓ Green checkmark: Already imported
  - Checkbox: Available for import
  - Disabled checkbox: Requires prerequisite (e.g., class must exist before startlist)

### Special Results Handling
  - Individual Competitions
    - Eliminated (EL): or = 'D', grundf = 999
    - Retired (RET): or = 'U', grundf = 999
    - Disqualified (DSQ): or = 'S', grundf = 999
    - Withdrawn: a = 'Ö' or special handling per round
    - No Show (NS): a = 'U', grundf = 999

  - Team Competitions
    - Riders who complete round 1 but not round 2 are marked as "Abstained"
    - Abstained riders: omh1f = 999, omh1t = 999, round2_in_team = true
    - Result preview shows: "8-ABST" (faults from round 1 + abstained)
    - Eliminated/retired riders keep their normal status (not converted to abstained)



### Possible Combinations

- ✅ **Classes only**: To prepare the meeting
- ✅ **Startlists only**: If classes already exist
- ✅ **Results only**: To update after competition
- ✅ **Classes + Startlists**: Complete import before competition
- ✅ **Classes + Results**: Import after with results
- ✅ **Startlists + Results**: Complete update
- ✅ **Everything**: Complete import at once

### Import Process Flow

- Search Event: Fetch event data from Hippodata
- Check Existing: Query Equipe for already imported items
- Display Selection: Show classes with import status
- Process Selection:
  - Import classes (if selected)
  - Import clubs (for team competitions)
  - Import people and horses
  - Import teams (for team competitions)
  - Import starts/entries
  - Import results (if selected)

## Debug Mode

Enable debug mode in `.env.php`:
```php
'DEBUG' => '1'
```

- This displays:
  - API requests made
  - Data received and sent
  - Transaction UUIDs for rollback
  - Team creation details
  - Import progress for each batch

- Batch Import Structure
  - The extension uses Equipe's batch API with proper ordering:
    - Classes/Competitions
    - Clubs (for teams)
    - People & Horses
    - Teams
    - Starts/Entries
    - Results

- Each batch uses a unique transaction UUID for potential rollback.

## Security

- JWT verification on each request
- Tokens stored outside source code
- HTTPS required for iframe cookies
- Input data validation
- CORS headers configured for app.equipe.com

## Troubleshooting

### Extension doesn't load

Check:
- HTTPS enabled on your server
- CORS configuration in index.php
- Correct JWT token in .env.php

### "FEI ID is required"

The FEI event identifier is mandatory. Format: integer number.

### Import status not showing

- Check API key permissions for GET requests
- Verify meeting URL is correct
- Enable debug mode to see API responses

### Teams not created

- Ensure "Team Class" checkbox is selected
- Verify nation has 3+ riders
- Check clubs endpoint is accessible

### Hippodata authentication error

Check:
- Bearer token in `.env.php`
- Token validity and permissions
- Format: `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`

### Partial import

If some competitions don't import:
- Check logs in debug mode
- Some classes may not have startlist/results
- Check competition status (official, cancelled, etc.)

### Duplicate riders/horses

The extension automatically avoids duplicates by checking:
- The `foreign_id` (FEI ID)
- The `fei_id` field
If duplicates appear, verify that FEI IDs are correct.

### Results showing incorrect status

- Abstained: Only for team competitions when rider doesn't start later rounds
- Eliminated/Retired: Keep their original status, not converted to abstained
- Check RESULTTOTAL.TEXT field in Hippodata response
